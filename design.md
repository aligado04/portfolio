# 2. System Design

## Architecture
- Ultrasonic sensor array → MCU → haptic driver + buzzer
- Power module (battery + charging) and enclosure

## Hardware
- Components list and reasoning (cost vs performance)

## Firmware & Control
- State machine for detection ranges and feedback patterns
- Debounce, filtering windows

## Enclosure & Ergonomics
- Materials, assembly, weather/impact considerations
