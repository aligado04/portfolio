# Ali Gado - Mechatronics & Autonomous Systems

I'm a Mechatronics & Autonomous Systems engineer focused on **embedded systems, controls, and practical robotics**. I like building things that work reliably in the real world, then proving it with **tests, data, and iteration**. This portfolio highlights selected projects and a multi-page case study of my **Final Year Project**.

**What you’ll find**
- Embedded & control projects (Arduino, PIC, MATLAB/Simulink, PLC/IIoT)
- CAD/PCB and electronics builds
- Structured write-ups with goals, approach, validation, and reflections
- Final Year Project with virtual + physical prototypes

## Year-by-Year Highlights

### Year 1 - Foundations
Built a strong base in **electronics, measurement, and embedded programming**.  
- [Current → Voltage Converter](projects/analogue-electronics-converter.md) - op-amp circuit with low-pass filter to convert motor sensor current into voltage.  
- [Pelican Crossing System](projects/pelican-crossing.md) - Arduino-based traffic/pedestrian light sequencing with button input and buzzer.  
- [Digital Lock System](projects/digital-lock.md) - PIC microcontroller lock with LED feedback and in-place password update.  
- [Mobile Phone Detector Circuit](projects/mobile-phone-detector.md) - RF-based detection prototype with sensitivity tuning.

### Year 2 - Electronics & Communication
Expanded into **linear design, communication systems, and applied mechanics**.  
- Group-built *Mobile Phone Detector* prototype, tested and presented.  
- Simulated **Double Side Band Amplitude Modulation (DSBAM)** under AWGN in Simulink.  
- Applied mechanics labs on **stress, strain, and vibration**.

### Year 3 - Robotics, IoT & Capstone
Advanced to **autonomous systems, IoT, and control engineering**, capped by a major dissertation project.  
- [Line-Following Robot](projects/line-following-robot.md) - navigation with LCD telemetry, audible alerts, and obstacle detection.  
- Extended the [Pelican Crossing](projects/pelican-crossing.md) with **pedestrian sensors** and **vehicle counting** for adaptive timing.  
- Proposed **Autonomous Delivery Drone** for logistics, considering AI-driven navigation.  
- **Final Year Project - Smart Assistive Navigation Cane:** multi-page case study with design, prototype, and testing.
