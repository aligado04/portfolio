# Ali Gado — Mechatronics & Autonomous Systems

I'm a Mechatronics & Autonomous Systems engineer focused on **embedded systems, controls, and practical robotics**. I like building things that work reliably in the real world—then proving it with **tests, data, and iteration**. This portfolio highlights selected projects and a multi-page case study of my **Final Year Project**.

**What you’ll find**
- Embedded & control projects (Arduino, PIC, MATLAB/Simulink, PLC/IIoT)
- CAD/PCB and electronics builds
- Structured write-ups with goals, approach, validation, and reflections
- Final Year Project with virtual + physical prototypes
