# Ali Gado - Mechatronics & Autonomous Systems Engineer

I design and build **reliable embedded systems, robotics, and control solutions**, from Arduino prototypes to Simulink-validated controllers. My work combines **hands-on hardware** (sensors, PCBs, CAD) with **software for autonomy and IoT**, backed by rigorous testing and iteration.
