# Hi, I'm Ali — Mechatronics & Autonomous Systems

Welcome! This portfolio highlights selected projects across **embedded systems, robotics, control, CAD/PCB, and IoT** — with a deep dive into my **Final Year Project** (a smart assistive navigation cane with both virtual and physical prototypes).

## Featured Projects

- **Final Year Project — Smart Assistive Navigation Cane**  
  Low-cost ultrasonic + haptic + audio feedback; virtual simulation & physical build; user testing and comparison with existing solutions.  
  → **Read case study:** [Final Year Project](projects/final-year-project/index.md)

- **Process Control — DS vs ZN vs Smith Predictor**  
  Simulink-based comparison on a delayed second-order plant; analysis of rise time, overshoot, stability, and control effort.  
  → [Project page](projects/process-control-comparison.md)

- **Line-Following Robot with Obstacle Avoidance & LCD**  
  Autonomous navigation, audible alerts, and telemetry on LCD; 3D-printed body.
