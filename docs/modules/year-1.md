# Year 1 — Summary

A foundation year focused on **electronics, measurement, and embedded programming**.

### Highlights
- **Current→Voltage Converter (Analogue Electronics):** Designed and simulated an op-amp circuit with a **50 Hz low-pass filter** to convert a remote sensor current (±2.5 mA) to a **2–3 V** signal; built and verified in Proteus. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
- **Oscilloscope & Signal-gen Labs (Professional Practice & the Environment):** Practical labs with PSU, DMM, function generator and scope; derived **V<sub>rms</sub> = V<sub>peak</sub>/√2**, explored **AC vs DC coupling**, and timing/frequency relations. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
- **Pelican Crossing System (Embedded Systems):** Arduino-based traffic/pedestrian light sequencing with button input and buzzer; simulated in Tinkercad/Proteus and built on breadboard. (Later evolved in Year 3 with **pedestrian detection** and **vehicle counting** for adaptive timing.)
- **Digital Lock (Embedded Systems):** PIC microcontroller lock with **4-bit code**, LED status, and **in-place password update**.
- **Mobile Phone Detector (Linear Design & Environment):** LM358-based RF detection with LED indicator, adjustable sensitivity (RV1/VR1), and notes on **2G/GPRS** performance. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
