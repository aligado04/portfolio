# Year 2 — Electronics & Communication

Focused on **communications, signal analysis**, and applying embedded systems to real-world robotics.

### Highlights
- **DSBAM under AWGN (Simulink):** Explored how **SNR (0–20 dB)** affects Double Side-Band AM with both **sine** and **square** message signals. Built a Simulink chain (Modulator → AWGN → Demodulator) and compared **Spectrum Analyzer** vs **Scope** outputs, confirming clearer peaks and waveforms as SNR increases. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

- **Autonomous Delivery Drone (Proposal):** Concept for last-mile delivery UAV with **360° sensing**, **LiDAR/ultrasonic**, **GPS/DGPS**, **4G/5G or satcom**, **redundant power**, **parachute recovery**, **collision avoidance**, and **ground-control UI**. Plan includes mission planning, risk assessment, and environmental/ethical considerations. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

- **Line-Following Robot (with LCD & Obstacle Avoidance):** Group build using **L293D motor driver**, **IR sensors** for line detection, **ultrasonic** for obstacle stop/resume, **buzzer** alert, and **16×2 LCD** telemetry. Documented pin mapping, issues (power, sensor tuning), and mitigation. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
