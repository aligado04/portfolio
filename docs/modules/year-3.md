# Year 3 - Robotics, Autonomy & Capstone

Year 3 combined **systems analysis, control, and applied autonomy**, culminating in my dissertation project: the **Smart Assistive Navigation Cane**.

### Highlights
- **Fleet EV vs PV Analysis (Engineering Management):** End-to-end TCO comparison with uncertainty modelling, risk/legislative factors, and environmental impact; outcome: hybrid fleet strategy during transition.
- **Optimisation & Genetic Algorithms (Autonomous Systems & ML):** Analysed benchmark functions (Six-Hump Camelback, Branin, Rosenbrock, Sphere, Rastrigin), implemented a GA in MATLAB, and studied effects of population size, mutation, and crossover on convergence.
- **Process Control Comparison:** Designed and simulated **Direct Synthesis**, **Zieglerâ€“Nichols**, and **Smith Predictor** controllers for a delayed second-order process; compared rise time, overshoot, stability, and control effort. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
- **Final Year Project - Smart Assistive Navigation Cane:** Three ultrasonic sensors (front/left/right), directional haptics, audible alerts, LED status, 3D-printed enclosure, blindfold trials; low-cost, modular design focused on usability.
