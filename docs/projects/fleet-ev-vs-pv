# Fleet EV vs PV Analysis (Engineering Management)

**Tags:** EV, PV, TCO, risk, environment

## Goal
Support fleet managers choosing between **electric (EV)** and **petrol (PV)** by comparing **total cost of ownership (TCO)**, **risks**, and **environmental impact** over a 5-year horizon.

## Method
- **Technology assessment** & **future trends** (battery costs, charging infra, regulation)
- **Market dynamics** & adoption scenarios
- **Cost modelling:** capex/opex, energy & fuel volatility, maintenance, residual value
- **Uncertainty:** sensitivity/what-ifs (energy price, duty, incentives)
- **Risk:** legislation, supply-chain, user acceptance, operational disruption
- **Environment:** WTW/LCAs, emissions projections
- **Contract & terms:** SLAs, uptime, performance bands

## Findings
- **EVs:** higher upfront; operational & environmental gains improve with infra and battery tech.
- **PVs:** lower upfront; exposed to fuel volatility and persistent COâ‚‚ burden.
- **Recommendation:** phased **hybrid fleet** during transition; periodically re-tune model as prices/policy shift.

## Reflection
Built practical skills in **lifecycle modelling, risk analysis**, and decision support for large-scale technical choices.
