# Mobile Phone Detector Circuit

**Module:** Linear Design & the Environment  
**Year:** 2  
**Tags:** electronics, RF, power, prototyping

## Goal
Short, outcome-focused statement of the problem you solved and why it mattered.

## System & Approach
- Brief architecture (diagram or bullet points)
- Hardware (MCU/SoC, sensors, actuators), Firmware/Control, Tools (Simulink/Proteus/etc.)
- Optional flowchart/state machine

## Validation & Results
- How you tested (bench, sim, field)
- Key metrics (latency, accuracy, rise/settle time, power)
- What “good” looked like and if you achieved it

## Reflection
- Trade-offs, lessons learned
- What you’d improve next
