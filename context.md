# 1. Context & Objectives

## Context
Brief literature and market scan (e.g., WeWALK, UltraCane, OrCam) and limits in cost, range, and feedback modalities.

## Objectives
1. **Affordability:** keep build around **Â£40** without compromising reliability.
2. **Sensing:** detect obstacles in common urban scenarios.
3. **Feedback:** intuitive **haptic + audio** cues.
4. **Power:** efficient runtime and simple charging.
5. **Validation:** blindfolded navigation trials; comparison to baselines.
